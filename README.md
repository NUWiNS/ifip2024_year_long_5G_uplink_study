The data for all the plots in the paper is located in the corresponding directories for each country. In each folder there are two python scripts (containing the scripts for the plots) and the required .csv files with the data. The "general.py" script plots the "Throughput", and "Latency" CDFs, whereas the "rsrp.py" plots the "RSRP" related plots. All the plots are saved in the "Plots" directory in PNG format.
